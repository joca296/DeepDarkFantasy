  "roomDesc": "A shallow pool of water covers the floor of this small round\nchamber. Floating serenely atop the waterâ€™s surface are two large\ndark purple lotuses, whose seed pods glow faintly in the darkness.\nStanding at the center of the room is a stone statue of a fish-like\nhumanoid garbed in priestly robes, its entire surface glistening\nwith a thin blackish mucuous. Held in its outstretched webbed\nhands is a ceremonial bowl filled with a dark purplish liquid.\nAs you enter the room, a primal thought begins to throb in\nyour head persistently. The thought coalesces into a message,\na command, growing more enticing and horrible with every\nrepetition. It says, 'mix the blood. Take the power.'",
